# SQL-BIG-DATA
For this assignment, we will be creating a table with data describing an underground tunneling project.

If you took the second course in this specialization (Analyzing Big Data with SQL), recall that the peer-reviewed assignment asked you to analyze flights data to select a profitable route for an underground high-speed rail tunnel. Based on your analysis and on other factors, construction has begun on a tunnel connecting San Francisco and Los Angeles. The tunnel will be dug over a period of ten years. It will be dug in three different sections by three tunnel boring machines (TBMs) named Bertha II, Shai-Hulud, and Diggy McDigface.

Each of these TBMs will generate a large volume of data as it operates. Each TBM will generate the data slightly differently. Simulated versions of the three TBM-generated datasets are provided. You must create a table on the VM and load these datasets into it. Then you must create and upload a document describing the steps you performed to complete this task.
